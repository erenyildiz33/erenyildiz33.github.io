I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in embedded systems with a particular focus on batteryless sensor devices. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Ege University, where my research concentrated on energy-harvesting systems powered by ambient sources such as RF, solar, and vibration. My work investigates system-level support for intermittently powered devices, contributing to areas like runtime software, hardware/software co-design, and intermittent computing. The central aim of my research is to enable ultra-low-power and self-sustaining systems that can operate reliably without batteries. By enhancing the programmability, energy efficiency, and resilience of these devices, I aim to contribute to the development of sustainable and environmentally conscious computing technologies for a greener future.

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
