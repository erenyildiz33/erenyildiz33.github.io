I hold a Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Engineering at Ege University, specializing in embedded systems. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the realm of batteryless sensor devices that harvest power from ambient energy sources like RF, solar, and vibration. Throughout my Ph.D. thesis, I have dedicated my efforts to investigating system support for these devices, particularly focusing on intermitting programming and developing novel runtime techniques and hardware advancements. The primary objectives of my research are to enhance the programmability, energy efficiency, and overall performance of batteryless devices.

### Research Interests

* Intermittent Computing
* Embedded Runtime Software
* Low-power Computing
* Energy Harvesting Systems
* Hardware Design
* Embedded AI
* Deep Learning

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
