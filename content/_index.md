      text:
        My research focuses on <b>enabling sustainable, ultra–low‐power computing platforms</b>  that operate reliably under <b>intermittent power conditions</b>  by leveraging ambient energy sources such as RF, solar, and vibration. I have developed novel timekeeping architectures, energy‐aware runtime systems, and resilient hardware/software co‐designs for the deployment of <b>self‐powered IoT devices</b> . With more than 10 peer‐reviewed publications, including in top‐tier venues such as   <b>OSDI, EuroSys, SenSys,</b> and <b>EWSN</b>, my work advances energy‐efficient sensing technologies for applications in smart infrastructure, healthcare monitoring, and environmental systems.
